# Machine Learning -- From Novice to Ninja


A collection of Free, online resources on mathmatics, statistics, and machine learnnig to
to take you from novice to ninja. Starts with basic probability and works it's way up to 
advanced statistical analysis courses.

Chosen because they are self pased, online videos so I can go at my own pace. Designed to take
6 - 12 months to complete all of the courses.

Left here as an open source reminder/checklist for myself.

The start of the Udacity video on machine learning is epic!
